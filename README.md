# Firefox Extension Generator

Easily scaffold a Firefox extension using this Yeoman generator.

## There are other generators out there, why should I use this one?

This generator prioritizes simplicity and flexibility. Unlike some alternatives, it doesn't impose specific build tools or testing frameworks. You have the freedom to use your preferred tools and methods, making the development process entirely tailored to your preferences.

**TypeScript is not supported yet, but it will be soon.**

## Features

- **Easy to use:** Just run `yo firefox` and follow the prompts.
- **Supports popup scaffolding:** Choose whether or not to scaffold a popup.
- _(TypeScript support coming soon...)_
